        I am a developer with 3 years of experience. I started with, like most
        Landing Pages and ReactJS projects, now I'm working on a large-scale
        commercial project in which I'm running the WEB version alone using a
        hybrid bundle of ReactNative+ReactJS+TypeScript+NextJS.
        <br /> I actively use the APPOLO CLIENT, WYSIWYG TIPTAP (text editor),
        STORYBOOK (for component control and system design support). Stack:
        Html5, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS, React Native, REST API,
        APPOLO, Figma, Storybook, Git, Swagger. Briefly about everyday tasks:
        API connection, component layout (of course this is adaptive layout for
        all types of devices), component connection, working with logic,
        component optimization. Also, work with the backender to optimize
        fields.
        <br /> Briefly about general knowledge and skills: I understand how
        react-hooks are used. I know the React JS architecture and what
        firewalls are. I understand what a heap of memory is, how a garbage
        collector works and how not to fly into a cyclical dependence. I write
        code using YAGNI, KISS, DRY. If you can do without layering JS : with
        native tools and without compromising the architecture, I will do it. I
        understand how SSR works. I translated legacy to NEXT 13 myself. I work
        together with i18Next. <br />
        What about soft-skills? Sociable: constantly in touch with the team. I
        am punctual: I am never late for meetings and do not delay deadlines. I
        work remotely all the time, while always in touch and at my workplace. I
        adequately treat reasoned criticism of myself.
